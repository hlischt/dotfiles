* My dotfiles
My personal configuration files and stuff. I'm trying to use the XDG Base Directory Specification as much as possible in order to avoid cluttering my home directory with dotfiles.

** Adding a new file
An all encopasing =.gitignore= is used for this repo, thus you need to use =git add -f [file]= to add a new file to the repo.

** How to deploy
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone --bare https://github.com/hlischt/dotfiles.git
mv dotfiles.git .git
git checkout
#+END_SRC
